### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tianheng Cheng, and have finished my Ph.D. career at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research goal is to enable machines/robots to **see**, **understand**, and **live** like human beings.

Previous works/publications are listed at [Google Scholar ðŸ“š](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PH8rJHYAAAAJ).

Currently, I'm devoted to research on **large multimodal models**, **foundational visual-language modeling**, and **image generation**. Before that, I mainly focused on fundamental tasks such as **object detection** and **instance segmentation**, as well as visual perception for autonomous driving.

**Highlighted Works of those pinned works:**

* ðŸ”¥ [ControlAR (arXiv)](https://github.com/hustvl/ControlAR) explores controllable image generation with autoregressive models and empowers autoregressive models with arbitrary-resolution generation.
* ðŸ”¥ [EVF-SAM (arXiv)](https://github.com/hustvl/EVF-SAM) empowers segment-anything (SAM, SAM-2) with the strong text-prompting ability. Try our [demo](https://github.com/hustvl/EVF-SAM) on HuggingFace.
* [OSP (ECCV 2024)](https://github.com/hustvl/osp) explores sparse set of points to predict 3D semantic occupancy for autonomous vehicles, which is a brand new formulation!
* ðŸ”¥ [YOLO-World (CVPR 2024)](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) for real-time open-vocabulary object detection; [Symphonies (CVPR 2024)](https://github.com/hustvl/Symphonies) for camera-based 3D scene completion.
* [SparseInst (CVPR 2022)](https://github.com/hustvl/SparseInst) aims for real-time instance segmentation with a simple fully convolutional framework! [MobileInst (AAAI 2024)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28555) further explores temporal consistency and kernel reuse for efficient mobile video instance segmentation.
* [BoxTeacher (CVPR 2023)](https://github.com/hustvl/BoxTeacher) bridges the gap between fully supervised and box-supervised instance segmentation. With ~1/10 annotation cost, BoxTeacher can achieve 93% performance versus fully supervised methods.
